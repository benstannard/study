What does the range func do?
     In each iteration of the loop, range produces a pair of values: the index and the value of the element at that index.
     In this example, we donâ€™t need the index, but the syntax of a range loop requires that if we deal with the element, we must deal with the index too.
     One idea would be to assign the index to an obviously temporary variable like temp and ignore its value, but Go does not permit unused local variables, so this would result in a compilation error.
