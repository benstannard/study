# What is an ACH Payment?
ACH = Automated Clearing House, a U.S financial network used for electronic payments and money transfers. Also known as **direct payments**. ACH payments are a way to transfer money from one bank account to another without using paper checks, credit card networks, wire transfers or cash.  

ACH payment volume is steadily growing. ACH network processed more than 25 billion electronic payments, totalling over $43 trillion in 2015.  

As a consumer, you are probably using the ACH network even though you might now be aware:
+ if you pay your bills electronically (instead of writing a check or entering a credit card number)
+ recieve direct deposit from your employer

For **businesses**, ACH payments are popular alternative to paper check and credit card payments. Because they are electronic, ACH payments are faster, and more reliable than checks, helping automate and streamline accounting. Generally, it also costs less to process and ACH transfer than a CC payment or wire transfer. If you're a business that accepts recurring payments, the savings can be significant.

# What's the difference between ACH payments, wire transfers, and EFT payments?
While ACH payments and wire transfers are both ways to move money between two accounts, there are a number of differences between them.
+ Wire transfers are processed in real time, as opposed to ACH payments, which are processed in batches three times a day. As a result, Wire Transfers are guaranteed to arrive on the same day, while ACH funds can take several days to process.
+ Wire transfers are also more expensive than ACH payments, while some banks don't charge for wires, others can cost $60

**ETF** payments (Electronic funds transfer) can be used interchangeably with ACHO payments. They both describe the same payment mechanism.

# Examples of ACH payments
There are two times of ACH payments:
1. ACH debits transactions involve money being **"pulled""** from your account.
2. ACH credit transactions let you **"push"** money to different banks (either your own or to others).

#### Direct Depost Payroll
Many companeis offer direct deposit payroll. They use ACH credit transactions to **push** money to their employees bank accounts at designated pay periods. (Employees need to provide a voided check or a checking account and routing number to set this up).

#### Recurring Bill Payments
Consumers who pay a business (insurance, mortgage lender) at certain intervals may choose to sign up for *recurring payments*. That gives the business the ability to initiate ACH debit transactions at each billing cycle, **pulling** the amount owed directly from the consumer's account.
